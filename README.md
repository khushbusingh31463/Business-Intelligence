# Motor Collision Analysis

## Introduction

The **Motor Collision Analysis** project aims to analyze crash data across multiple cities, identifying trends and patterns to enhance traffic safety insights. The project utilizes advanced BI tools for data profiling, integration, and visualization to provide a detailed analysis of crash incidents, contributing factors, and high-risk areas.

## Key Features

- **Data Profiling**: Conducted data profiling using **Alteryx** to assess data quality by identifying issues like missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent date formats. Documented inconsistencies to ensure robust data governance.
  
- **Dimensional Modeling**: Utilized **ER Studio** to create a dimensional model that ensured high performance in querying and visualizing the crash data for impactful analysis.

- **Data Integration**: Leveraged **Talend** for ETL processes, loading data into target tables, and connected **Tableau** to the relational database for real-time querying of integrated data.

- **BI Reporting**: Developed comprehensive, data-driven visualizations using **Power BI** and **Tableau** to offer actionable insights and support decision-making.

## Insights

- **Time-Based Analysis for Crashes**: Visualized crash trends across various times (day, week, year) to identify peak accident periods.
  
- **Pedestrian Accident Reports**: Detailed analysis of fatalities involving pedestrians.

- **Top 10 Contributing Factors**: Identified the most common factors leading to crashes.

- **Top 5 Areas with Most Crashes**: Highlighted regions with the highest crash frequencies.

- **Top 5 Areas with Most Fatalities and Injuries**: Focused on areas with the most severe outcomes.

- **Top 5 Vehicles in Crashes**: Analyzed the types of vehicles most frequently involved in collisions.

- **City-Specific Dashboards**: Developed dashboards for **New York**, **Austin**, and **Chicago** to showcase city-specific crash data insights.

## Technologies Used
